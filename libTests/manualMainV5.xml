REQUIRED computational parameters

1) Run name
***********
the run name correspond to the created folder name with results (in folder ECOGEN/results/)

2) Output mode
**************
Allow choice for output format
Implemented format : XML ou GNU
Binary mode : false (ASCII) or true (binary)
(Optional) precision of output files (number of digits). If not precised, set as default.

3) Time control mode
********************
Choice for simuation time control, two possibilities :
a) iterations="true" : control the simulation time using iteration number. Output printing frequency is set in iteration number.
b) iterations="false" : control the simulation time using a physical time in seconds. Output frequency printing is set in physical time in seconds

<timeControlMode iterations="false">
  <iterations number="3" iterFreq="1"/>
  <physicalTime totalTime="8.e-3" timeFreq="8.e-4"/>

4) CFL criteria (Courant number ratio)
**************************************
set a security marge accordingly to numerical scheme stability (real lower than 1.)

OPTIONNAL computationnal parameters

*) Scheme precision order
*************************
default (without this xml node), the scheme is first order in time and space. Possible using of a second order scheme in time and space using MUSCL method with TVD limiters.
Available limiters are : minmod, vanleer, vanalbada, mc, superbee, thinc (only for volume-fraction limiter).
The choice of the limiters is divided into four parts:
- global limiter: applied everywhere and on all variables unless it is overwrite by the following optional limiters.
- interface limiter: applied on all variables but only at the interface location. By default is equal to the global limiter.
- global volume-fraction limiter: applied everywhere but only on the volume-fraction and transport equations (THINC is only applied on the volume fractions) unless it is overwrite by the interface volume-fraction limiter. By default is equal to the global limiter.
- interface volume-fraction limiter: applied only at the interface location and on the volume-fraction and transport equations (THINC is only applied on the volume fractions). By default is equal to the interface limiter.

*) Restart a simulation
***********************
Restart a finished computation from the result file number. For AMR simulations, one also needs to specify the frequency at which restarts are saved (default is 0).

*) 1D output Cut
****************
Possibility to extract 1D output cuts from multiD computations. Define a line using a vertex and direction vector.
Cut results will be placed in the corresponding results folder under GNU format.

*) 2D output cut
****************
Possibility to extract 2D output cuts from 3D computations. Define a plane using a vertex and normal vector.
Cut results will be placed in the corresponding results folder under GNU format.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% << copy between these lines

*) Probes
*********
Adding probes at chosen location in the physical domain. Define a name, a vertex and time recording parameters
<probe name="capteur1">
  <vertex x="0.51" y="0.51" z="0.51"/>
  <timeControl acqFreq="-1."/>       <!-- if negative or nul, recording at each time step -->
</probe>
